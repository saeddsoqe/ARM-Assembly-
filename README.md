# ARM-Assembly-
some tasks using the ARM assembly 

THE TARGET THAT USED IN THIS PROJECT (Silicon labs->EFM32GG Series->EFM32GG9900) 

AND THE IDE IS KEIL 5

in this file you will find solutions for those tasks 

Write values 100 and 0x1FFFFFF into registers R0 and R1.

Load from RAM memory with location 0x20001000 four bytes into register R1.

Write 0xFF value (one byte length) to RAM memory location 0x20001000.

Set and clear single bit at position 25 of variable (variable address 0x20001000).

Decrement register for 10 times until zero (use SUBS instruction).

Read both stack registers (MSP, PSP) into R0 and R1 registers.

Read programa counter(PC) to R0 register.

Create simple delay function (pass variable into R0 how much to delay).

Create function wich call delay function (also pass R0 as variable for delay).

Multiply R0 register by 3 ussing single ADD instruction (use barrel shifter).

Reverse all bits for register R0.

Create function: reverser byte order for long long variable (64 bits length).
